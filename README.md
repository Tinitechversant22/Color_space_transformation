Overview

This project demonstrates real-time applications of color space transformations for image and video processing. It includes implementations for face detection, object tracking and  video compression using OpenCV and Python.

Features

1. Face Detection: Detect faces in real-time using grayscale conversion.
2. Object Tracking: Track colored objects in live video using HSV color space.
3. Video Compression: Record and compress video using the YCbCr color space.

Requirements

Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
NumPy (numpy)
You can install the required packages using pip:
  pip install opencv-python numpyOverview
